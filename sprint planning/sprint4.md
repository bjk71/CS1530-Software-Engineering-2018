Timer:
As a player, I would like the option of having a time limit indicated (in seconds). This timer will be displayed on the screen and will count down to zero from the time limit while it is the users turn.
(Must be done in separate thread.)
(The time counter only has to operate for the human player.)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 points 
Upon reaching zero, the text of the timer will change to "FOLD" and the player will automatically fold.
(Must be done in separate thread.)

As a player, I would like to select the save game option that writes the current state of the game onto a file so it can be resumed later.

As a game administrator, if a player wants to call but does not have enough money, I want them to be able to do so through the implementation of side pots, in accordance with the rules. (finish from last sprint)

As a player, I want side pots to be somehow indicated visually, so that I can easily tell how much is in them. (finish from last sprint)
