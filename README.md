### Issues & Branches

An issue should be made for every change you want to make. When making an issue, tag it with the appropriate label. The labels are:

`bug` - Something isn't working

`feature` - New feature

`refactor` - Change old code

`task` - Non-coding task

All changes for an issue should be made on a branch for that issue. To name branches, use:

`[issue-type]/[issue-name]`

For example:

`bug/fix-card-shuffling`

`feat/add-betting-functionality`

`ref/update-menu-buttons`

`task/write-sprint-report`

When making a pull request, add the appropriate issues to the description using the keyword `closes #[issue-number]`. This will close the issue automatically when the pull request is accepted.

### Coding Style

Define variables at the top of their scope.

Java Swing objects should have names starting with an underscore.

Tabs or spaces: spaces, tab size = four spaces.

Curcly braces: same line, space before curcly brace
